# nes-pride
Convert images of pride flags into [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System)-compatible format.

The Python script that converts the image data is under construction; the NES program hasn't even been started yet.

[Source of flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_flag#Gallery). The license of this project does not apply to the flag images (I guess).
