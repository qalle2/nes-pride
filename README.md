# nes-pride
Convert images of pride flags into [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System)-compatible format.

Project status:
* Python script that converts the image data: almost ready
* NES program that shows the images: at an early stage (only shows one flag and not correctly)

[Source of flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_flag#Gallery). The license of this project does not apply to the flag images (I guess).
